==== Summary for Stationarity Tests ====

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 1h T:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 1h SWDR:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 1h rh:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 6h T:
The time series is non-stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 6h SWDR:
The time series is non-stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 6h rh:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 24h T:
The time series is non-stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 24h SWDR:
The time series is non-stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 24h rh:
The time series is stationary

Non-stationarity series that need to be differenced for applying AR models: [('6h', 'T'), ('6h', 'SWDR'), ('24h', 'T'), ('24h', 'SWDR')].

Stationary series that do not need to be differenced for applying AR models: [('1h', 'T'), ('1h', 'SWDR'), ('1h', 'rh'), ('6h', 'rh'), ('24h', 'rh')].

==== Differencing Non-Stationary Series and Re-Testing ====

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 6h T:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 6h SWDR:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 24h T:
The time series is stationary

Results of Dickey-Fuller Test for 24h SWDR:
The time series is stationary

After differencing:

Still non-stationary: [].
Now stationary (all): [('1h', 'T'), ('1h', 'SWDR'), ('1h', 'rh'), ('6h', 'rh'), ('24h', 'rh')] + [('6h', 'T'), ('6h', 'SWDR'), ('24h', 'T'), ('24h', 'SWDR')].
